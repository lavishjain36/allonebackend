# all-in-one-hacksprint-backend

This backend is made on top of node js. My backend mainly consists of four sections first get method so as to know the server is working fine. second part is the order section where anyone can order food. Next section is items section where anyone can come and give details about missing and found items next is report section where you can report for any misbehaviour or not working properly. and finally payment confirmation and otp section.
